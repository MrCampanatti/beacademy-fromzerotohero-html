    <p>Out of all five main characters, Shiryuu is known as the calmest and most collected. His sheer physical strength is the greatest of the bronze saints, with perhaps the exception of Phoenix Ikki.This is reflected in his ability to have won numerous battles without his Dragon cloth. Shiryuu trained at the <strong>Five Old Peaks</strong> in China to obtain the bronze cloth of the Dragon constellation, and his mentor was none other than senior gold saint, Libra Dohko. <br>Shiryuu sports a large tattoo-like image of a green and <em>white dragon</em> on his back (however it is said in the manga and the anime that it is not a tattoo but is connected to his guardian dragon star and only appears as his cosmo is rising). Whenever his life is in danger, the tattoo-like image begins to fade away—once it completely vanishes, it is a sign that Shiryuu's cosmos is nearing zero—as in death.
